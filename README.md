# Persona

Persona is a web application (currently hosted on Heroku, here: https://spotify-persona.herokuapp.com/persona) using Spotify API to make a comprehensive analytical dashboard on the user's music tastes

Persona specifically analyzes the user's curated playlists, as it seems the trivial and most reliable way to pinpoint music the user listens to normally/regularly
